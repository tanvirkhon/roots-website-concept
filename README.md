# Roots Landing Page Redesign

## Description

For this website redesign, I choose to remake the landing page for the current Roots Inc (https://rootsrus.org/) website so that it is more fun and interactive. The current Roots Inc website is a bit outdated with a huge hero image followed by a few sections of information.

Current Roots website:

In order to keep to the "roots" of the organization I attempted to create a children's story book style landing page with a Parallax effect using JavaScript. I was inspired to do this by the Firewatch video game website (https://www.firewatchgame.com/). It is a small independent video game that has a really cool website. I wanted to capture some of that magic from the Firewatch website to the Roots Inc website.

I created an initial sketch of what I wanted to do and worked off that. Though I was not able to implement all that I wanted I am happy with the final product as a first attempt.
